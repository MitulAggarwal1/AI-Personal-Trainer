- Limited to static hand gesture detection.
- Served as a stepping stone for full-body tracking.

***

## Version 2: Full-Body Pose and Squat Analysis  
Upgraded to MediaPipe Holistic, enabling full-body, face, and hand landmark detection. Introduced joint angle calculations for detecting squat form and posture.
- Added flipped webcam feed for natural user perspective.
- Included injury profile inputs for personalised coaching.
- Delivered real-time textual feedback on squat posture.

***

## Version 3: Multi-Exercise AI Trainer with Verbal Coaching  
Transitioned to MediaPipe Pose for detailed landmark detection, supporting a variety of exercises and stretches. Added fault detection with severity gradation and rep counting.
- Implemented text-to-speech for real-time verbal coaching.
- Introduced timers for stretches and breaks.
- Designed user profiles to adapt feedback.

***

## Version 4: Recovery Plan Assistant with GUI  
Introduced a full Tkinter GUI enabling symptom input and personalised recovery plan generation based on rule-based logic.
- Added scrollable exercise selection for generated plans.
- Pop-up windows present exercise instructions.
- Implemented break timers between sets.
- Enhanced user input validation and GUI responsiveness.

***

## Version 5: Standardized Plans and Enhanced Usability  
Standardised the format of recovery and workout plans, expanding the exercise and stretch repertoire to include movements such as goblet squat, dumbbell row, and figure-4 stretch.
- Unified fault detection and form scoring for all exercises.
- Used coloured fault annotations signalling severity: mild, moderate, critical.
- Made plan parsing more robust, improving button-driven session launching.
- Streamlined GUI design for clearer navigation.

***

## Version 6: Enhanced Stability and Accuracy  
Focused on improving system robustness and biomechanical accuracy by fine-tuning angular thresholds for fault detection.
- Refined rep counting and phase detection with smoothing over frames.
- Improved GUI input validation and error handling.
- Optimised feedback logic for clearer form scoring.
- Maintained extensive exercise coverage with consistent instructions.

***

## Version 7: Optimized Fault Detection Thresholds  
Further tuned angle thresholds, setting stricter biomechanical standards to reduce false positives and improve user safety.
- Adjusted severity classifications for fault detection messages.
- Continued to preserve and polish the user experience.
- Recalibrated posture checks across exercises.
- Maintained all key features from previous versions.

***

## Version 8: Machine Learning Integration for Plan Selection  
Replaced the rule-based plan selector with a decision tree classifier trained on labelled symptom-profile data, enabling adaptive personalised recovery plans.
- Supported encoding of categorical features via label encoders.
- Introduced supervised learning-based decision-making enhancing flexibility.
- Maintained all prior pose analytics and GUI features.
- Allowed scalability with growing datasets and refinement over time.

***

## Version 9: Mature ML Plan Selector and Scalable Architecture  
Consolidated machine learning integration with improved data preprocessing and model robustness.
- Enhanced encoding pipelines for categorical symptom data.
- Continued wide exercise and stretch library support with detailed instructions.
- Preserved real-time pose analytics, fault detection, and form scoring.
- Maintained a polished Tkinter-based GUI enriching usability and clarity.
- Designed for continuous data collection and retraining capabilities.

***

## Version 10: Declarative Fault Rules and Simplified Rep Detection  
Revised fault detection approach using a declarative dictionary structure, allowing simple extensibility and easier maintenance.
- Simplified rep detection with start/end conditions defined via lambda functions per exercise.
- Improved modularity by separating metric extraction, fault detection, and scoring into distinct, maintainable units.
- Continued using machine learning-based plan prediction.
- Enhanced break timer visuals with dynamic countdown frames.
- Sustained full GUI functionality with dynamic exercise selection.
- Focused on a clean and scalable architecture ready for ongoing development.
